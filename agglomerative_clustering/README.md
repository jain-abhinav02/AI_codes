### Agglomerative Clustering

A hierarchical clustering method in which the clusters which are the closest as per a distance metric are merged together recursively. The distance metric can be one of the following :

1. Single Link : The distance between two cluster is the smallest distance between any point p1 of C1 and p2 of C2.

2. Complete Link : The distance between two cluster is the maximum distance between any point p1 of C1 and p2 of C2.

3. Group average : The distance between two clusters is the average of the distance between every pair of points p1 of C1 and p2 of C2.

4. Centroid distance : The distance between two clusters is the distance between their centroids.
